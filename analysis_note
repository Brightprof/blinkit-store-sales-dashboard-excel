## Analysis & Insights

### 1. Sales by Outlet Size
- Large outlets contribute the highest share of total sales.
- Medium outlets perform better than small outlets but still trail large outlets.
- This suggests that larger store formats generate higher customer traffic and order volume.

### 2. Sales by Outlet Location
- Tier 1 locations generate the highest revenue among all location types.
- Tier 3 locations contribute the lowest sales, indicating lower demand or purchasing power.
- Expansion efforts may yield better returns in Tier 1 and selected Tier 2 areas.

### 3. Product Category Performance
- Fruits and Vegetables and Snack Foods are the top-performing categories.
- Categories such as Seafood and Breakfast generate relatively lower sales.
- Inventory and marketing focus should prioritize high-performing categories.

### 4. Fat Content Analysis
- Regular fat content items account for a larger percentage of total sales compared to low-fat items.
- Consumer preference appears to favor regular variants over low-fat alternatives.

### 5. Outlet Type Performance
- Supermarkets outperform grocery stores in total sales and average sales.
- Grocery stores show higher item counts in some cases but lower average sales per item.
- This indicates supermarkets are more effective at driving higher-value purchases.

### 6. Sales Trend Over Time
- Sales show a steady upward trend over the years.
- A noticeable peak occurs around 2018, followed by stabilization.
- This trend may reflect changes in market conditions or expansion phases.
